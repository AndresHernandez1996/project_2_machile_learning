**Project 1 – Video Game Success Analysis**

[Notebook del Proyecto](./3269200a-875b-4222-a958-a0a1e76a80f0.ipynb)

This project involves creating a machine learning prototype for Zyfra, a company that develops efficiency solutions for the heavy industry. Using gold extraction and purification data, the objectives are:

- Clean and preprocess the data (handle missing values, scale features, and encode variables).  
- Explore correlations and patterns between process variables and extraction performance.  
- Perform feature engineering to generate new predictive features.  
- Train and compare regression models (linear regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) using scikit-learn in Python.  
- Evaluate performance with metrics such as R², MAE, and RMSE, and tune hyperparameters via cross-validation (GridSearchCV).  
- Deliver a functional prototype with recommendations to optimize production parameters and maximize profitable extraction.
